Marie Kondo your Thinkpad with this decluttered Debian setup. Joy!

Having been an avid Thinkpad user for nearly 20 years now, it was @sushimako and Jameson in a garage in Walnut Creek that convinced me to switch to Linux and haven't looked back since. Main components of the setup:

* Debian
* Tiled window manager (https://awesomewm.org in our case) so reduced that it'd delight Richard Sapper [1]
* Bunch of carefully chosen small helpers to make life easier

As always standing on the shoulder of giants:
